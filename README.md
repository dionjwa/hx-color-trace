# hx-color-trace

Simple globally imported `trace` colored statements.

E.g.:

	traceRed("...");//Text is red on the CLI/terminal
	traceGreen("...");

# Usage

	haxelib install hx-color-trace

Then in the root of your project, copy the import.hx which just consists of

	import package t9.util.ColorTraces.*;

Then you can call the above trace statements anywhere in your code.
